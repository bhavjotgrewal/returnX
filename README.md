# ReturnX: AI-Powered Returns Management Platform

## The Problem

E-commerce returns represent a $816 billion problem globally, with return rates reaching up to 40% in some categories like apparel. This not only impacts profit margins but also creates significant environmental waste and operational inefficiencies. Traditional returns processes are:

- Overly manual and labor-intensive
- Lacking in data visibility and analytics
- Missing opportunities to reduce return rates through product improvement
- Creating poor customer experiences
